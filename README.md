Version: 1.0 <br>

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encrypting messages, named after Julius
Caesar, who reportedly used it to protect his military communications. <br>
This technique involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of places. For example,
with a shift of three, the letter ‘A’ becomes ‘D’, ‘B’ becomes ‘E’, and so on. <br>
Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher formed the groundwork for modern cryptographic techniques. <br>
